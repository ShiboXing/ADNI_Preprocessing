MincView is a visualization tool. The source code forms part of a larger IGNS application called ibis.
You may find the description of the application at 
http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftwareVisualization/MincView

1. Directory Content
    Applications/Basic - GUI and basic functionality
    Application/MincView - main application
    CMakeCommon - FindMinc.cmake, install uninstall cmake
    GlobalIgns - headers and general use functions
    icons - application icons
    vtk - classes derived from vtk
    CMakeList.txt - main CMake list

2. External Dependencies
    Qt 3.3
    vtk5.4.2+
    CMake 2.6-patch 4+
    MINC 1x or MINC 2.x, netcdf, hdf5 and z libraries

3. Supported file formats
    *.mnc, *obj, .*tag
    MincView (1.6.4) is built with Minc 1.x or 2.x libraries but supports files only in MINC 1 format.
 

4. Building - presuming you unpacked into directory /dir/mincview
   a/ create directory Igns in your home directory and put there mincview.png from directory icons
   b/ create build directory  /dir/build
   c/ cd build
   d/ cmake ../mincview or ccmake ../mincview
   set necessary options:
   
       BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                OFF
       CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY    2.6

       VTK_DIR                          /YOUR_VTK54_DIRECTORY/lib/vtk-5.4

   please note, not all the options show at the beginning, the last one will be IGNS_BUILD_MINC_VIEW, 
   so you have to press c few times.
   
   e/ make 
   
   Optional:
   f/ make install (if you wish and have administrators rights).
   g/ in order to run MincView from command line, if you use csh or tcsh in your .cshrc
      setenv PATH ${PATH}:your_installation_path
      setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "/YOUR_VTK5.4_DIRECTORY":${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
